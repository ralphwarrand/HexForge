# Hexahedron

[![CMake Build](https://github.com/ralphwarrand/Hexahedron/actions/workflows/cmake-platform.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ralphwarrand/Hexahedron/actions/workflows/cmake-platform.yml)

This project uses CMake and GitHub Actions for CI to ensure cross-platform compatibility on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows. The goal of this project is to have a framework from which crossplatform development can go smoothly. The framework should be capable of supporting the development of 3D graphical applications and uses OpenGL to achieve this.
